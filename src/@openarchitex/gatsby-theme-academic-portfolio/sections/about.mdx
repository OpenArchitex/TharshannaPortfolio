My academic experience, working as an Assistant Professor with a solid research background and teaching various online
and face to face courses. I am interested in developing a career that combines teaching and research while maintaining
my research interest in health data analysis, data science with computer applications and commitment to excellent
pedagogical practises, and a demonstrated interest in teaching-related scholarly activities.
