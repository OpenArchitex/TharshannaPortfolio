## Statistical Applets for Learning

Technology can be used to improve the understanding of statistical principles by providing students with visual and dynamic presentations
of ideas and making it possible for students to investigate the methodologies. We have constructed various interactive statistical applets
for these purposes under [Dr. Variyath's](https://www.mun.ca/math/people/ppl-faculty/variyath.php) supervision during my graduate program. These can be very effective in teaching a wide range of
statistical concepts. These applets are most appropriate for lower-level undergraduate statistics courses, and they facilitate the investigation
of statistical concepts rather than calculation or analysis. We selected a few statistical techniques for developing applets. The factors considered
for selecting methods are the importance of frequently used techniques, their difficulty to understand, and their usability in practice. A set of
specific techniques identified are summary statistics, histograms, sampling techniques, probability, normal distribution, scatter plot, and regression.
