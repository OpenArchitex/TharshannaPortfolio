## Research

The majority of the research I have completed and continue to pursue fall under the broad umbrella of empirical-likelihood-based variable selection, especially in
generalized linear models, survival analysis, and longitudinal studies. I became interested in this work as a doctoral candidate, where I sought to find efficient
and consistent inference for the parameter of interest when the model is unspecified.

I'm working on expanding my expertise in these areas of data mining techniques regard high-dimensional inference and include exploratory data analysis (EDA),
dimensionality reduction, visualization, loss-based estimation with cross-validation (e.g., density estimation, classification, regression, model selection),
cluster analysis, and multiple hypothesis testing.
